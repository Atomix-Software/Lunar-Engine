# Lunar Engine

A Game Engine meant for any sort of graphical application creation.
It will mostly be source heavy, meaning in this context, that you need to understand C++ to some degree.
I don't want to use Unity anymore so I'm developing this.

## Samples
- Astroids (coming soon)

## Libraries
- freetype
- glfw
- glad
- glm
- libogg
- libvorbis
- openal-soft (you need to use cmake and build this yourself)
- stb libraries
- spdlog
